# RK3399 Register Maps

This crate provides the structure definitions for the RK3399 SoC register maps in Rust generated using the `svd2rust` tool. The SVD file was obtained by parsing the Rockchip RK3399 Technical Reference Manual. The scripts used to generate the SVD file can be found in the [`CaptainIRS/rk3399-trm`](https://github.com/CaptainIRS/rk3399-trm) repository.
